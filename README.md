## 🚀 Setup [WSL] 

[In case of Bash or Fsh or Other, base commands should be the same, feel free to format them if needed for they are already simple...]

For the setup, just run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hurshbajaj/Ion && cd Ion && make build
```

## ▶️ Try the First Example

To try out the first example, feel free to run:

```bash
make run --file t1.io
```

## 💡 REPL Mode

Moreover, we even have a REPL — if you're simply looking for some light play with my project 🤗🤗🤗

```bash
make run --repl 
```
