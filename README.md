## 🚀 Setup [WSL] [In case of Bash or Fsh or Other; base commands should be the same, feel free to format them if needed for they are already simple]

For the setup, just run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hurshbajaj/Ion && cd Ion
```

## ▶️ Try the First Example

To try out the first example, feel free to run:

```bash
ion --file t1.io
```

## 💡 REPL Mode

Moreover, we even have a REPL — if you're simply looking for some light play with my project 🤗🤗🤗

```bash
ion --repl 
```
