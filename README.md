## 🚀 Setup [WSL] 

[In case of Bash or Fsh or Other, base commands should be the same, feel free to format them if needed for they are already simple...]

For the setup, just run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hurshbajaj/Ion && cd Ion && make install && make build
```

## ▶️ Try the First Example

To try out the first example, feel free to run:

```bash
make run file="examples/t1.io"
```

Or if you want to let your own creativity run wild, feel free to

```bash
make run file="examples/main.io"
```
[Editing it however so you want]

## 💡 REPL Mode

Moreover, we even have a REPL — if you're simply looking for some light play with my project 🤗🤗🤗

```bash
make run 
```
